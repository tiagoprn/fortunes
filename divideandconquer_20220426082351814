%
- What is an algorithm that makes use of the Divide-And-Conquer technique?
Quicksort.
%
- What are the 2 steps of solving a problem with the Divide-And-Conquer technique?
1) Figure out the base case (the simplest case)
2) Divide or decrease the problem until you reach the base case.
%
- Is Divide-And-Conquer an algorithm?
No. It is a way to think about a problem.
%
- When you have a recursive function that operates on an array, what is generally the base case?
